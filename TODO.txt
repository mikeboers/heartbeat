- authentication on all pages except login

- standardize on "id" or "pk"

- limit length of name, status, description, etc

- worker should notify when there is a state change
  - send emails, connect to prowl, and whatever else.
  - service.status(time=None) will check most recent as of the given time
  - service.add_beat() will check the new one vs the old one as of one minute earlier

- how to merge multiple active probes into a single heartbeat?

- active DNS probe:
  - mikeboers.com/MX should go to google apps
  - mikeboers.com/A should go to my web server

- login with username/password in master configfile
    - every endpoint except "heartbeat_api" should be forced to be authed
    - OR accept any signed requests? Would need to include "_path" key in signature
      and maybe a "_method" along with "_nonce".

      def sign(data, path=None, method='POST'):
            data = dict(data)
            data['_path'] = request.path_info if path is None else path
            data['_method'] = method
            return hmac(key, '&'.join('%s=%s' % x for x in sorted(data.iteritems())))

    @sig_includes('name') decorator to specify that the other parameters can
     vary

    - sign the `curl` URLs
        - for now can just include a v=1 along with a nonce, and sign that
        - can ban nonces in the future if they are problematic
