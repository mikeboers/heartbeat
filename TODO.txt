- Get the domain name in the worker (for emails).

- expand on labels to include a description for a rollover, e.g.:
    ('stale', 'warning', 'The service expected another heartbeat after this one.')
    ('code-1', 'error', 'The service returned a non-zero code upon exit.')

- standardize on "id" or "pk"

- limit length of name, status, description, etc

- how to merge multiple active probes into a single heartbeat?

- active DNS probe:
  - mikeboers.com/MX should go to google apps
  - mikeboers.com/A should go to my web server
